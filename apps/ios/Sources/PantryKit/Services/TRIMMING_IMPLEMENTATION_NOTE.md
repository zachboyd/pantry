# String Trimming Implementation

## Current Status

Whitespace trimming is **implemented and active** in the service layer.

## Implementation Details

1. **String Extensions** (`Utilities/String+Trimming.swift`)
   - `string.trimmed()` - Removes leading/trailing whitespace
   - `string.needsTrimming` - Checks if trimming is needed
   - Performance optimized with early exit for strings that don't need trimming

2. **Service Layer** - Services use `.trimmed()` before sending data to GraphQL:
   ```swift
   let trimmedName = name.trimmed()
   let trimmedDescription = description?.trimmed()
   ```

3. **Interceptor** - `StringTrimmingInterceptor` is integrated but can't modify variables due to Apollo iOS limitations

## Apollo iOS Limitation

Apollo iOS doesn't allow interceptors to modify request variables. The interceptor is ready for when Apollo adds this capability.

## Usage Guidelines

**✅ DO**: Use `.trimmed()` in service methods before creating GraphQL inputs
```swift
CreateHouseholdInput(
    name: name.trimmed(),
    description: description?.trimmed()
)
```

**❌ DON'T**: Add manual trimming in ViewModels - let services handle it

## Future

When Apollo iOS supports variable modification in interceptors, the StringTrimmingInterceptor will handle all trimming automatically, and service-layer trimming can be removed.
