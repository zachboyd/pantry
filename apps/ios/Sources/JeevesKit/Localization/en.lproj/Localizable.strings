   JeevesKit
   
   PLURALIZATION FORMAT:
   For strings that need plural support, use pipe-separated format:
   "key" = "singular form|plural form";
   
   Example:
   "items.count" = "%d item|%d items";
   
   The singular form (left of |) is used when count == 1
   The plural form (right of |) is used for all other counts (0, 2, 3, etc.)
   
   Use with Lp() function: Lp("items.count", 5) → "5 items"
