# Pantry iOS - Current Implementation Status

*Last Updated: January 27, 2025*

## Overview

The Pantry iOS app MVP is substantially complete with core architecture, services, and UI foundation in place. The app follows clean architecture principles with MVVM pattern, dependency injection, and GraphQL integration.

## Implementation Summary

### âœ… Completed (Production Ready)

#### Core Architecture
- **BaseViewModel** with `@Observable` macro for reactive state management
- **DependencyContainer** with comprehensive service lifecycle management
- **Dual AppState Implementation**:
  - `MockAppState` for UI development
  - `AppState` (RealAppState.swift) for production
- **ViewModelError** enum with pantry-specific error handling
- **LoadingStates** class for operation-specific loading management
- **EnvironmentKeys** for SwiftUI dependency injection

#### Service Layer
- **GraphQLService** - Low-level Apollo client wrapper
- **ApolloClientService** - Apollo configuration and setup
- **HouseholdService** - Complete CRUD operations for households
- **UserService** - Mocked implementation (returns "Test User")
- **UserPreferencesService** - Settings and preferences management
- **AuthService** - Authentication infrastructure (partial)
- **Service Protocols** - Clean abstraction for all services

#### GraphQL Integration
- **Apollo iOS v1.23.0+** integrated and configured
- **Code Generation Pipeline** fully operational
- **Type-Safe Operations** for all queries/mutations
- **Authentication Interceptors** ready
- **Multi-Environment Support** (local/dev/prod)
- **Generated Types** from backend schema

#### ViewModels
- **Authentication**: LoginViewModel, SignUpViewModel
- **Onboarding**: OnboardingViewModel, OnboardingCoordinator
- **Household**: HouseholdListViewModel, HouseholdEditViewModel, HouseholdMembersViewModel
- **Tabs**: PantryTabViewModel, ChatTabViewModel, ListsTabViewModel (placeholders)
- **Settings**: SettingsViewModel
- **Common**: AuthenticationViewModel, BaseViewModel patterns

#### UI Components
- **Navigation Structure**: Tab bar with 4 tabs
- **Authentication Views**: Sign in/Sign up screens
- **Household Management**: Create, edit, view, member management
- **Onboarding Flow**: Welcome and household creation
- **Settings Screen**: Profile and preferences
- **Shared Components**: Loading views, empty states, headers
- **Design System**: Color tokens, typography, spacing

### ðŸš§ In Progress

#### Better-Auth Integration
- Cookie-based session management (infrastructure ready)
- Session persistence in Keychain (AuthTokenManager ready)
- Hydration query implementation needed
- Session restoration on app launch

#### UI Polish
- Full household switcher implementation
- Member invitation flow
- Enhanced empty states
- Loading state refinements

### ðŸ“‹ Not Started (Post-MVP)

#### Features
- Pantry item management
- Shopping lists
- Recipe management
- Chat functionality
- Real-time updates (subscriptions)
- Offline support
- Push notifications

#### Technical
- Comprehensive test suite
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced iPad layouts
- Widget extensions
- Analytics integration

## Key Implementation Details

### Authentication State
- Infrastructure complete with `AuthService` and `AuthTokenManager`
- Cookie-based session ready to integrate
- Keychain storage implemented
- Missing: Better-Auth API integration

### Data Flow
1. **GraphQL API** â†’ Apollo Client â†’ Services â†’ ViewModels â†’ Views
2. **State Management**: AppState (global) â†’ ViewModels (feature) â†’ Views
3. **Navigation**: Type-safe with NavigationDestination enum

### Mock vs Real Services
- **Real**: GraphQLService, HouseholdService, UserPreferencesService
- **Mocked**: UserService (intentionally, as per requirements)
- **Partial**: AuthService (infrastructure only)

## Configuration Status

### Development Environment
- âœ… Local GraphQL endpoint configured
- âœ… Development bundle ID set
- âœ… Code signing ready for simulator

### Build Configuration
- âœ… Swift 6 with strict concurrency
- âœ… iOS 18+ deployment target
- âœ… Apollo code generation automated
- âœ… Multi-environment support

## Next Steps Priority

### Immediate (Complete MVP)
1. Complete Better-Auth integration
2. Implement session restoration
3. Polish household switcher UI
4. Add member invitation flow

### Short Term (Post-MVP)
1. Comprehensive test suite
2. Performance profiling
3. Enhanced error handling
4. Accessibility audit

### Long Term (Future Releases)
1. Pantry items feature
2. Shopping lists
3. Recipe management
4. Real-time updates

## Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. Some Apollo concurrency warnings (cosmetic)
2. Preview data needs enhancement
3. Loading states could be smoother

### Documentation Gaps
1. Test strategy documentation needed
2. Performance guidelines pending
3. Contribution guide missing
